Say at least one way in which it benefits you that others are happy.
It’ll be more easy for them to help me if I need it.***They won’t hurt me. *** They’ll create a happy and good environment, provoking in me a state of well-being too.
2
Say at least one advantage of being “wisely selfish” and behaving kindly and good with others.
Others will tend to behave kindly with me, and that will make me feel good. *** Others will speak well of me, and that will make it easier for me to meet new people with which to establish healthy relationships with. *** I’ll feel good upon realizing that being kind with others makes others feel good.
3
Say at least one typical situation in which you forget to thank others, but if you did it’d make them feel good.
When my parents make an effort and do anything for me to be well. *** When a teacher takes something seriously that, both my classmates and me, actually learn and enjoy his classes. *** When a friend does something for me, even if it’s hard for them.
4
Say at least one reason why you usually don’t express thanks when someone does something for you.
Because I trust the person who did something for me and I consider it unnecessary to thank them. *** Because I take it for granted, especially in the case of my family, as the other one is forced to do whatever they do for me. *** Because I’m ashamed.
5
Say at least one reason as to why being sincere makes your life easier.
Because there’s 3 things that cannot be hidden for a long time: the Sun, the Moon, and the truth. As a consequence, whoever lies lives with the permanent fear of being found out. *** Because whoever lies doesn’t know which task he just undertook: he’ll be forced to invent 20 others to keep it. *** Because non-Verbal communication says a lot more than the verbal one, so even if others don’t know for sure that he lied, my gestures and looks will make them mistrust me.
6
Say at least one non-Verbal gesture that could mean someone’s lying.
That they don’t look at the eyes, that they blink a lot or looks in a strange way: very fixated and for a long time. *** That they slightly hide their mouth. *** That they expose too much information or that they complain about external factors to try and give credibility to the excuse they’re making up.
7
Say at least one fact that shows that despite the discourses and public declarations, in the west we don’t value the life of a westerner and someone who’s not the same way.
The refugees’ drama that authorities don’t intend to take in. *** The immigration drama, with the thousands of drowned people every year next to our coasts. *** That a lot of western countries export weaponry from poor countries where inner wars are taking place whose consequences are mainly felt by the civil population.
8
Say at least one example that reflects the nonsense of the uneven distribution of riches in the world.
That in the west every time we flush the toilet we use more drinkable water than most people in poor countries has daily to drink. *** That just 62 people have as much wealth as half the world’s population. *** That, in a world of seven billion people, with enough production capabilities to feed a population of twelve billion, almost a billion people are starving.
