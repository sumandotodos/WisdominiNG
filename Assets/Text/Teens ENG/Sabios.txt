1
Say at least one typical situation in which you could lose your temper.
When my parents ground me to not go out.***When a friend organizes something and doesn’t tell me about it. *** When my partner gets stubborn over something.
2
Say at least one reason why going through life judging others is an attitude that harms yourself.
Because if others listen to me judging people that are absent, they might think that when it’s them who aren’t there, they’ll equally be the target of my judgment and criticism. *** Because criticizing others for their flaws might make me feel superior and grow distant to others. *** Because if I criticize someone for something I do too sometimes, on a subconscious level I’ll be critical with myself, and sooner or later, that criticism will come out to make me feel bad.
3
Imagine at least one past circumstance that could be influencing the other to behave in a harmful manner 
Maybe when they were a kid they were bullied at school. *** Maybe their parents got divorced when they were young, and they didn’t pay all the needed attention to them during a key age of their development. *** Maybe I subconsciously remember them of someone who embittered their lives in the past.
4
Say at least one effect produced by observing the positive qualities of the person we’re angry at.
I get closer to the truth, since when I am angry with someone I tend to look only at the negative. However, that person (just like me) has bad things, as well as good things. *** Maybe I’ll end up remembering the good things that person did for me in the past, and that way start reconsidering my attitude towards them rather than getting carried away with anger. Since the other way I could end up regretting it later, when I realize that person is not as “evil” as I had imagined them. *** I’ll be closer to finding a friendly solution to whatever conflict it is, which would be beneficial both for me and for the other person. And if it’s not possible to find a friendly solution, at least whatever the other one does will not affect me so much.
5
Say at least one negative think you’ve pointed out of someone, that might explain a projection of your own weakness.
Sometimes I criticize a friend for planning and not warning me, when I do the same thing too sometimes. *** Sometimes I criticize an acquaintance for being somewhat arrogant at certain moments, but sometimes I have that attitude too. *** Sometimes I’ve spoken badly of a friend who doesn’t treat their partners very well, but I’ve sometimes acted in a similar way with mine.
6
Say at least one positive quality you’ve seen in someone that might be a positive quality in you.
Sometimes I admire a friend for how hard-working they are. *** Sometimes I admire the generosity a friend of mine often shows. *** Sometimes I value the listening capability a friend has when someone tells him a problem.
7
Say at least one subconscious mechanism that makes us project our own defects on others.
Maybe I am criticizing the other one in something I don’t feel secure about, because I am trying to show publicly that I am better than the other one in regards to that. *** Maybe I tend to discover more easily on others those weak spots that are familiar because they’re present on me too. *** Maybe if I criticize a defect of someone else in a loud voice I am trying to show others that I don’t have that defect, which will provide me with apparent security in something I feel insecure about.
8
Say at least one thing that is common to everybody.
We all want to be happy and not have a bad time. *** We’re all born and we’ll all die. *** We all want to keep our lives.
9
When we think about something negative of someone, sometimes we might think there’s nothing wrong with it because that person cannot read our thoughts and therefore nothing bad is going on. Say at least one reason as to why this isn’t like that.
When I am with that person my non-Verbal language will give me away, without me noticing, that I feel some antipathy towards them. *** If later when I am with that person trying to be kind to them, I’ll feel on a subconscious level that I am being a bit fake or hypocritical. *** My thoughts are the precursor to my words and actions, so I let myself get carried away with negative thoughts that could have as a consequence that my relationship with that person gets much worse.
10
Say at least one advantage of feeling the ultimate responsible of whatever happens to you and how you take it.
I’ll get going more easily to transform that which I want to change in my life. *** I will not play victim, feeling bad about it. *** I will not get angry with others, feeling bad for myself and making others feel bad.
11
Say at least one situation in which you blamed others for something in your life that made you uncomfortable, rather than realizing that you’re the only responsible of how you take what happens to you.
My studies are an uphill battle and I subconsciously blame my parents for forcing me to study. *** I don’t have enough money to go out and I blame my parents for not giving me more money.     *** I don’t like a house rule and I blame my parents for deciding which rules are followed at home.
12
Say at least one advantage of sincerely expressing out loud the virtues of others.
The others will not see me as a rival but as someone with high self-esteem who isn’t ashamed of saying out loud the virtues of others. *** Others will appreciate me and, naturally, will see the virtues in me. *** I’ll create a good environment, which will benefit us all.
13
Say at least one advantage of not gossiping about others.
People will trust in me and tell me personal things, since they’ll know I won’t go around telling them. *** People will look at me as an upright person that doesn’t need to gossip about others to be interesting. *** The person I talk to will not subconsciously think that, just as I gossip about others, I’ll gossip about them.
