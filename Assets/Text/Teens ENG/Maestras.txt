Because it’d mean to admit that I’m wrong, and on a subconscious level that can frighten me because I could think that my intelligence is being questioned. *** Because despite of how common it is for my opinions to come from the influence of others rather than my own personal reflection, I’ve come to identify myself so much with my viewpoints that I’ve come to think that they’re exclusively mine and have a hard time getting rid of them. *** Because on a subconscious level I identify myself with my ideas and beliefs so much that changing my beliefs I consider as a way of abandoning my identity.
